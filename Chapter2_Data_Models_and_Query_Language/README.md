# Chapter 2 *Data Models and Query Language*

The most interesting thing described in this chapter outside of my prior knowledge is [graph data models](https://neo4j.com/blog/data-modeling-basics/). 

The idea of graph data models sounds fascinating, it seems to be a new way of looking at data -- rather than collapsing properties into individual entities (nodes), how about exposing them (the properties) and elevating them to the status of entities as well with explicit relationships (edges). so instead of joining tables (with different rows of entities), we hop along edges.

where can this type of data modelling be best applied? I still am not quite sure. But, graph data model has definitely piqued my interest, having said so, I have created a [seperate repo](https://github.com/cynichloe/graphie) to study it more in depth.
